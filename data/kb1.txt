Solr Error : ["undefined field local"] errors in the logs
 Switch language  Permalink to this article
Description
Errors similar to the following can be found in the log records:

Error: Solr Error : ["undefined field query"] - Query attempted: [query: <name of field>]
or

Error: Solr Error : ["undefined field local"] - Query attempted: [local: <name of field>]
The root cause of this issue is that all queries that start from the query: or local: prefix lead to generating the query to Solr. However, a request to the index during resolving the data source for the SXA component must not be sent.

Solution
To resolve the issue, consider one of the following options:

Upgrade Sitecore XP instance to Sitecore XP 10.0 and SXA 10.0.0 or later.
Download and install the corresponding cumulative hotfix or patch compatible with the affected product version available in:
For Sitecore XP 9.3 and SXA 9.3.0: KB1001754
For Sitecore XP 9.2 and SXA 1.9: KB1001753
For Sitecore XP 9.1.1 and SXA 1.8.1: KB1001751
For Sitecore XP 9.0.2, download and install the patch compatible with the affected  Sitecore XP and SXA product version found on this page:
https://github.com/SitecoreSupport/Sitecore.Support.368851.373937/releases
Note that the issue does not affect the resolving data source process, therefore, such errors can be safely ignored.
